This may include your computer's **Internet Protocol (IP) address**, browser type, browser version, the pages of our Service that you visit, the time and date of your visit, and the time spent on those pages.</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>3. Data Security</h3>
        <p>The security of your data is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
        <p>Specifically, your Kanban data (tasks, boards, columns) is stored securely and is only accessible by you and other users you explicitly share the boards with.</p>

        <h3>4. Disclosure of Data to Third Parties</h3>
        <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your Personal Data to outside parties, except in the following limited circumstances:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>**Service Providers:** We may employ third-party companies and individuals to facilitate our Service (e.g., hosting providers). These third parties have access to your Personal Data only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.</li>
            <li>**Legal Requirements:** We may disclose your Personal Data in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a legal obligation, protect and defend the rights or property of [**Your Company Name/Website Name**], or protect the personal safety of users or the public.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5. Retention of Data</h3>
        <p>We will retain your Personal Data only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. We will retain and use your Personal Data to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations (for example, if we are required to retain your data to comply with applicable laws), resolve disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies.</p>

        <h3>6. Your Data Protection Rights</h3>
        <p>Depending on your location, you may have the following data protection rights:</p>

            <li>The right to **access**, update or to delete the information we have on you.</li>
            <li>The right to **rectification** if that information is inaccurate or incomplete.</li>
            <li>The right to **object** to our processing of your Personal Data.</li>
            <li>The right to **withdraw consent** at any time where we relied on your consent to process your personal information.</li>
