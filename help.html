        <h1>Help</h1>
        <p>Welcome to the help page for <span class="light-blue">Join</span>, your guide to using our kanban project
            management tool. Here, we'll
            provide an overview of what <span class="light-blue"> Join</span> is, how it can benefit you, and how to use
            it.</p>
        <h2>What is Join?</h2>
        <p><span class="light-blue"> Join</span> is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by a group
            of dedicated students as part of
            their web development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.</p>
        <p>Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize work, limit
            work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow). <span class="light-blue"> Join</span> leverages the
            principles of kanban to help users
            manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual interface.</p>
        <p>It is important to note that <span class="light-blue"> Join</span> is designed as an educational exercise and
            is not intended for extensive
            business usage. While we strive to ensure the best possible user experience, we cannot guarantee consistent
            availability, reliability, accuracy, or other aspects of quality regarding <span class="light-blue">
                Join.</span></p>
        <h2>How to use it?</h2>
        <p>Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use <span class="light-blue"> Join:</span></p>
        <div class="flex-row">
            <h2 class="margin-0">1.</h2>
            <h3 class="margin-0">Exploring the Board</h3><br>
        </div>
        <p class="margin-0">When you log in to <span class="light-blue"> Join</span>, you'll find a default board. This
            board represents your project and
            contains four default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", “Await feedback” and "Done".</p>
        <div class="flex-row">
            <h2 class="margin-0">2.</h2>
            <h3 class="margin-0">Creating Contacts</h3>
        </div>
        <p class="margin-0">In <span class="light-blue"> Join</span>, you can add contacts to collaborate on your
            projects. Go to the "Contacts" section, click on "New contact", and fill in the required information. Once
            added, these contacts can be assigned tasks and they can interact with the tasks on the board.</p>
        <div class="flex-row">
            <h2 class="margin-0">3.</h2>
            <h3 class="margin-0">Adding Cards</h3>
        </div>
        <p class="margin-0">Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards. Cards represent individual
            tasks. Click the "+" button under the appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the task details in the
            card, like task name, description, due date, assignees, etc.</p>
        <div class="flex-row">
            <h2 class="margin-0">4.</h2>
            <h3 class="margin-0">Moving Cards</h3>
        </div>
        <p class="margin-0">As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on the board by dragging
            and dropping the card from one list to another.</p>
        <div class="flex-row">
            <h2 class="margin-0">5.</h2>
            <h3 class="margin-0">Deleting Cards</h3>
        </div>
        <p class="margin-0">Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list or delete it. Deleting a
            card will permanently remove it from the board. Please exercise caution when deleting cards, as this action
            is irreversible.</p>
        <p>Remember that using Join effectively requires consistent updates from you and your team to ensure the board
            reflects the current state of your project.</p>
